0.25 (January 14 2000): A small bug fix.
* Removed a memory leak reported as Debian bug #50140 by Daniel Burrows.
* Since my last update, newer versions of GTK have added a mysterious new
error message to the startup of the game, wherein it will inform you that
something that shouldn't be realized is, or something that is realized
shouldn't be.  In any case, the GTK developer that I received e-mail from
thinks that this is because I'm trying to hook the size allocation signal,
which I obviously was not, but then I described the error in a rather
shoddy fashion so I probably deserved a shoddy answer.  If I instead of
realizing, perform an actual show followed by a hide, I get a different
error at a different place and I'm treated to a lovely empty window
popping up as well.  I guess the problem is that I'm trying to attach my
pixmaps to multiple windows in a cheaty way or something, and really I
ought to simply use GNOME because everyone else uses it and there's
probably some #ifdef YOU_ARE_MIGUEL in GTK to allow this sort of stuff.  
Either that, or perhaps if I actually spent many more hours than I already
have trying to understand the GTK source code I just might be able to
figure it out, and get rid of this tiny little entirely non-critical error
message.  Alternatively, I could use GNOME.  Well, I have for my new game
Glotski, but nobody seems to be e-mailing about the game except to say
that they can't get it to work so I'll call it all a bust and leave this
damn error message here for someone to fix it for me if they want.  I can
just leave it there and sulk, which is what I am doing for now.  Finally,
I can whine at the community to fix it for me.  I'll arrange for some sort
of prize if you do, but only if you manage to explain to me why what you
did works while what I did does not, as well as why your way could be
construed as better. The prize will be small and almost but not entirely
worthless.  As a hint to help start you off, try moving around lines 852
and 853 in main.c.  Try putting 'em right near the front.

0.24a (July 30 1999): I'm an idiot.  (But you knew that already, right?)
* Wrong net version in gfp.h and the README.  Duh.  (Thanks William Ono
for pointing out).  I was afraid I'd do this eventually.

0.24 (July 29 1999): Oh That Magic Build Process.
* Thanks to the the efforts of Paul Jenner (psj@mustec.eu.org), the game
now uses an autoconf build process, that is, you use ./configure, then
make, then make install.
* Also fixed the folder picture to reflect the current gnome-stock icon.

0.23 (July 22 1999): A couple of fixes, and level save/restore.
* Yep, level save/restore implemented, complete with bugs, no doubt.  The
controls are available in the config dialog.  The buttons are a little
hideous because Tuomas' site was down this morning at 4 AM, so I could
only find some older version.  Will fix in next release.  Sigh.  Anyone
chump enough to write a level editor?  The format is extremely simple and
should be obvious from reading the dialog.c source.  I probably won't
write one, at least not soon.
* Should have nailed Debian Bug #41688, reported by Robert Cheramy
(tibob@via.ecp.fr), which caused a client segfault if you tried to do two
network games in one session.  (Due to the server not initializing a
value.)  Thanks to William Ono (wmono@debian.org), package maintainer, for
not being too terrible in leaning on me to fix it.
* Should have also fixed minor update bug remaining from board notation.
* Have realized that the code is hideous.  Feeling great shame.  Will
hopefully fix it sometime in the future.  Will not call this 1.0 until the
code looks a lot better.  At least the resulting binary probably isn't
really horrible.  It does compile cleanly, anyway, on my box at least.  Am
working on the Other Game, though, right now.  Want to get it
substantially done before descending back into academia and losing all but
smidgens of free time.

0.22 (July 13 1999): A couple of small fixes.
* The board notation stuff had a couple of bugs.  One of them messed up
network play severely.  Another made the rotation through the pieces a
little screwy.  These were fixed.

0.21 (July 13 1999): A few tweaks.
* Dylan Thurston (Dylan.Thurston@math.unige.ch) added a patch to clean up
the method used to flip back and forth between boards, by modifying one of
Tuomas' icons and changing the icon used.  Seems like a good solution.
Dylan also made the adjustors for x and y size have a maximum of 20, as
100 was a bit large.  I left the version stamp for the config file the
same, so take care that your board size isn't set obscenely large when you
start up 0.21 for the first time.
* Added a method of board notation as reminders to yourself.  Right-click
(button 3) on a grid square to flip between circle, triangle, square, and
nothing.  The symbols are intentionally meaningless; come up with your own
system.  They are not communicated via network play.

0.20 (July 12 1999): MULTIPLAYER!
* Implemented multiplayer.  Kickass.  They'll all worship me now. Note:
Still not very tested.  Expect problems.  Should not affect single player
operation though.
* Updated README to reflect multiplayer changes.  Still an unreadable
mess.  Next major version (0.3x) will hopefully be the cleanup version.
* Fixed a number of minor interface issues.  Things are cleaner now.
* Added the oft-requested feature to show your guess along with the actual
board.  (Use the "conversion" button that appears to flip between the
two.)
* Fixed a small bug mentioned by Yoni Elhanani (biggo@netvision.net.il)
involving the resizing of the game window when it shrinks vertically.
* Fixed a fairly major bug with the help of Mads Dyndesborg
(madsdyd@challenge.dk) involving the test for equivalence.
* Still have to clean up the code some, come up with some
better documentation, etc.

0.12 (June 10 1999): Couple of little bugs fixed.  UNRELEASED.
* Scott Stanley (god@twistercom.com) mentioned that setting all the
sliders to 0 would cause an unceremonious crash.  Whoops.
* Erich Rickheit mentioned that I should be using srandom(), not srand(), 
to seed random().  Duh.

0.11 (June 9 1999): Small patch to improve portability.
* Erich Rickheit (rickheit@mirrorimage.net) sent a patch fixing a problem
that caused GFP to work improperly on non-x86 machines, a pointer
alignment issue. (A "bug," if you will.)  Thanks, Erich!  Now, it works on
Sparcs running Solaris.

0.10 (June 1 1999): First release.
* Fully playable, etc.
* Some things can be done to fix it up.
