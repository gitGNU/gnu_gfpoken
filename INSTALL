Thanks to the efforts of Paul Jenner (psj@mustec.eu.org), GFingerPoken now
has a proper build procedure.  The old build procedure (which was a simple
Makefile that utilized gtk-config) is now present in Makefile.old.

Requirements: GTK+ 1.2 or higher.  I have only built this under Red Hat so
it may not work on other systems.  However an older version functioned on
my cruddy Sun IPX so perhaps it will.  GTK+ has its own requirements as
well, obviously (namely X11).  If you can compile this under Win32 tell
me, as I've tried and failed miserably.

To build and install:

1) Type "./configure"
2) Type "make" - You may need GNU make.
The binary should compile without warnings.  (Not that this means that my
code is any good.)
3) As root, run "make install" or alternatively, copy the binary "gfpoken"
to the place you want it to go.
4) That's it.  (All graphics, etc. are internal to the program so you
don't need to worry about your path or anything.)  Just type "gfpoken" to
start 'er up.  If you want to dock GFP with Window Maker, you should
probably "cp iconpix.h /usr/share/pixmaps/gfpoken.xpm" and then use its
icon for the dock icon. (The .h file is in actuality an xpm.)
